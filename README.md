 Overview
This project allows you to control your mouse cursor using only your eyes through a webcam.  
It uses MediaPipe FaceMesh for facial landmark detection, OpenCV for image processing, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse.

Features:
- Move the mouse cursor by tracking eye movements.
- Blink to select text (mouse click-and-hold).
- Scroll up/down by moving eyes vertically.
- Visual feedback on actions (blinking, scrolling).
